# What is SkidPanelTemplate?
SkidPanelTemplate is a template for a DDOS template (Note, this does NOT include a DDOS API. You will need to purchase one with your own money). So in other words, this is just a UI.
# Requirements
* Visual Studio
* DDOS API
# Usage
1. Open the project
2. Add an API 
3. Edit the project to work with your API
4. Profit.
# Errors
1. GunaUI - Simple fix, your Guna did not install correctly with the project, download GunaUI2 in the Nuget Package Manager.
2. Discord -  Also another simple fix, same solution, go to Nuget Package Manager and search "lachee" and it should be the first package.
Any other errors feel free to contact me on Discord @Woke#9718
# Cant download GunaUI or DiscordRPC? I'll include them in the project
